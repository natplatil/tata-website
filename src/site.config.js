  about: "Art is Life, as much as Life is Art. \n I see the world through creative eyes, always drawn to beauty, but also aware of life’s complexity. My goal is to create expressive portraits that resonate deeply, allowing others to look and say, “Yes, I understand.” \nMy artistic journey began with black-and-white film photography in Prague, Czech Republic, where I learned the foundations of light, shadow, and composition. I later earned my Master of Fine Arts degree from the American Film Institute in Los Angeles, which shaped my eye for storytelling and visual expression. \n Over the years, I’ve directed video productions, worked with television networks, and now dedicate myself fully to portrait photography. Every session is an opportunity to create meaningful art while helping my clients see themselves in a new, empowering light.",
